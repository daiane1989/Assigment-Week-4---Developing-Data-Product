## Assigment week 4 

This is an apresentation about a submission for the Course Developing Data Product. The app that I build use the data mtcars and make a regression model. The response variable is Miles Gallon(mpg). You can choose which variables you want to test.

## Summary of the data set

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## We want to predict Miles Gallon(mpg)

```{r pressure}
plot(mtcars$cyl,mtcars$mpg)
```
